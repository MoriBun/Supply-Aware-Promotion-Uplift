"""Helpers for the result notebooks in ``notebooks/`` (task H6.1, decisions H-27).

A notebook only calls functions of ``analysis/``; this module gives every notebook the
same first cell::

    from analysis.notebook import require_runs, setup
    from analysis.plots import save_figure

    plt = setup()
    sweep_dir, gte_dir = require_runs("runs/s5/sweep_ring1_dr", "runs/b7a/gte")

``setup`` makes paths independent of where the notebook runs from (``notebooks/``):
it moves to the repository root, so ``runs/...`` and ``config/...`` resolve as on the
command line. ``require_runs`` fails at once, naming every missing input, instead of
in the middle of the notebook; ``runs/`` is never committed, each input is rebuilt
with the command of ``docs/datasets.md``.
